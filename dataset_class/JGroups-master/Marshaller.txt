 * Estimates the number of bytes needed to serialize an object to an output stream. This is used to create an output stream with an initial capacity, so it does not need to be exact. However, if the estimated size is much smaller than the actual size needed by the arguments, the output stream's buffer will have to be copied, possibly multiple times.

 * @param arg the object; argument to an RPC, or return value (could also be an exception). May be null (e.g. anRPC returning void)

 * @return the estimated size
